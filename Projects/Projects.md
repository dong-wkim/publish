- [[Forest Plot Generator]]
	- Custom R function to generate forest plots from continuous and dichotomous datasets.
- [[Medical Illustrations]]
	- Publish medical illustrations.
- [[Lattice Forest Plot Generator]]
	- Custom R function to generate a summary forest plot of multiple outcomes in case there are too many forest plots to publish into one article (as usually is the case).
- [[Literature Search Results Deduplication]]
	- Deduplication is most often error-prone, especially when using Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote. Manual deduplication is time-consuming and is also prone to human error. This python script combines manual selection of columns, and automates deduplication with a prototype error rate of 0%.
